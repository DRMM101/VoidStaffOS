# CLAUDE.md — HeadOfficeOS Project Instructions

## Progress Logging

After each completed task, append to `PROGRESS.md` (in the project root: `C:\users\derek\documents\HeadOfficeOS\PROGRESS.md`):

- **Date/time**
- **Task**: what was requested
- **Decisions**: choices made and reasoning
- **Changes**: files modified/created
- **Status**: complete / partial / blocked

Do not overwrite existing entries — always append under the `## Progress Log` section at the bottom of the file.
